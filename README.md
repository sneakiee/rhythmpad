# rhythmpad

This was a YSWS project for Hack Club's hackpad for hack club's highway! I got the idea of creating a hackpad for rhythm games, but I also wanted to generalize it more for music, so I decided to make it into a drum-pad by creating square keycaps! The switches are mapped to the numpad from 1-9 and the extra button on the right being 0. This was my first actual hardware project and I hope to build more because it was a frustrating fun (I need to feel more of that.
